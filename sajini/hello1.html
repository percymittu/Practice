Nature has been  humans and ever since it has taken care of mankind and nourished it forever. 
In other words, it offers us a protective layer which guards us against all kinds of damages and harms. 

Survival of mankind without nature is not possible and humans need to understand that.
If nature has the ability to protect us, it is also powerful enough to destroy the entire mankind.
