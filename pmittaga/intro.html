    <p>
        GitHub is a website that stores 
         <br>

        Git can keep track of changes made to code, synchronize code between different people, test changes to code 
        without losing the original, and revert back to old versions of code.
        
        <br>

        When combining different versions of code, e.g. using git pull, a merge conflict can occur if the different versions 
        have different data in the same location. Git will try to take care of merging automatically, but if two users edit, 
        for example, the same line, a merge conflict will have to be manually resolved.
